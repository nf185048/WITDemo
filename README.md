# Girls Who Code Partnering with Women in Tech

This code demo will demonstrate a typical day at work for a frontend developer!

## Tasks at hand

1. **We have received a new design!** Turns out the color palette in the old interface wasn’t accessible - this means that the color wasn’t dark enough to create a contrast with the background, so users can struggle to see the content on the page (especially visually impaired users!). How can we update the interface?

2. **The total cost isn’t calculating correctly!** Notice that the final cost displaying is the cost of the last item in the checkout list. We want to display the TOTAL cost of ALL items in the list. How  can we fix this calculation error?
